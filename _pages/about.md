I'm notgull! I'm currently a Computer Science student, hoping to eventually be a Computer Science notgull. 

I got my hands on a QBASIC interpreter at the age of 8, and ever since I've been
programming in some way, shape or form. Here's a handful of projects I've worked on:

- I created the [`breadx`](https://github.com/bread-graphics/breadx) implementation of X11, which was the only X11 implementation in Rust that supports async, and still the one that does it best.
- I maintain [`smol`](https://github.com/smol-rs/smol), an async runtime for Rust that focuses on a lack of clutter.
- I'm a frequent contributor to [`softbuffer`](https://github.com/rust-windowing/softbuffer) and [`winit`](https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit), two libraries that aim to make the Rust GUI story read a lot better.

In 2017, I began writing for the [SCP Wiki](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/notgull). Since
then, I have written over 70 SCPs and tales. Highlights include 
[my 001 proposal](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/not-a-seagull-proposal),
[SCP-3733](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-3733),
[Team Bird](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/bird), and
[The Little Robot that Could](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/the-little-robot-that-could).

I also create animations and other things on my 
[YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCa22ge_MKVapVkX8lN1jDuQ), if that's
your flavor.
