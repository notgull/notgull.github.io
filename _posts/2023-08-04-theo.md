Today I'm happy to officially announce a project that has been the culmination of about five months of work. This makes it probably the most involved programming project I've ever done, and I'm proud of the final result.

The GUI ecosystem in Rust is still in a nascent stage. There are well-defined ecosystem crates for doing certain things, like [window management](`winit`). On the other hand, other essential GUI components are still wanting for a good solution. In my own travels, I've found that there's no good out-of-the-box solution to *vector graphics* yet, which is an essential part of any GUI. The closest thing is [`piet-common`], but it's hard to integrate into non-[`druid`] systems like [`winit`].

[`theo`] is my attempt at resolving this issue. It's an implementation of [`piet`], a common vector graphics API, that can be used with any windowing system that implements the [`raw-window-handle`] traits. The goal is to provide a system that can be effortlessly plugged into whatever system you already have in place, and provide a simple, easy-to-use API for drawing vector graphics.

It has a number of benefits over [`piet-common`] and other contemporary solutions. First of all, as mentioned, it works with the [`raw-window-handle`] interoperability traits, meaning that it should, in theory, work anywhere. Another primary benefit is its use of GPU acceleration. Where possible, it uses either [`wgpu`] or OpenGL as the underlying drawing backend, which should provide benefits for systems with lower CPU power, like Risc-V boxes. However, it is able to fall back to a software rasterization backend based on [`tiny-skia`] and [`softbuffer`], which should work on any system that can run [`winit`].

[`theo`] also uses very few system libraries. [`piet-common`] brings in `cairo` on Linux. On the other hand, aside from GPU libraries like Vulkan and windowing libraries like X11, [`theo`] depends on very little.

If you're building a GUI system, consider giving it a try! See the examples in the repository for [an example](https://github.com/notgull/theo/blob/main/examples/winit.rs) of how to use it.

## The Vellophant in the Room

At the time of writing, the Linebender team is working on a similar vector graphics system named [`vello`]. It uses GPU acceleration via [`wgpu`] and is designed to work with systems like [`winit`] as well. So why did I go to all the effort? Why not just wait for [`vello`] to be ready?

First of all, [`theo`] and [`vello`] use different strategies. [`vello`] is a *compute*-based renderer, while [`theo`] uses a *rasterize* renderer. The difference comes down to strategy: [`vello`] tries to use the GPU to the fullest extent by uploading vector data to the GPU and then rendering it there. On the other hand, [`theo`] uses a more traditional strategy: converting shapes on the CPU to textured triangles and then pushing those to the GPU. It is this author's opinion that the rasterization-based strategy is more ergonomic and easier to cache, so I created [`theo`] around this strategy. Your mileage may vary.

There are some other minor differences, but overall once [`vello`] is actually released it should work similarly to [`theo`]. It's a matter of API preference, really.

## Other Crates

While building [`theo`], I had to write a handful of other crates to make the current Rust rendering ecosystem easier to work with. Here's a quick rundown of them:

- [`line-straddler`], which generates underlines and strikethroughs for glyphs.
- [`piet-cosmic-text`], which provides a uniform text rendering interface for [`piet`] using [`cosmic-text`].
- [`piet-tiny-skia`], which implements a [`piet`] backend using [`tiny-skia`].
- [`piet-hardware`], which converts [`piet`] rendering calls to buffering textured triangles.
- [`piet-glow`], which implements a [`piet`] backend using OpenGL.
- [`piet-wgpu`], which implements a [`piet`] backend using [`wgpu`].
