excerpt: Standalone hardware-accelerated drawing for Rust's GUI ecosystem.

---

Right now, there isn't a good drawing framework for Rust. Actually, I lie, there is a good one; [`piet`]. However, it's pretty tightly tied to the [`druid`] ecosystem. However, adapting it to other frameworks is relatively dfficult.

[`winit`] is a fantastic crate, but it doesn't come with a real way to draw to the screen. This is intentional; it prevents the [`winit`] team from needing to maintain a drawing library in addition to the already-very-large windowing library. However, it means that, when it comes to drawing, there's no real "out of the box" solution. When you Google "winit drawing", the first post recommends using [`druid-shell`] instead of [`winit`]. There *are* other drawing frameworks, but they're usually tightly integrated into a GUI framework, and are often difficult to extract into something useful.

The [`piet-glow`] crate is a step towards solving this problem. It's standalone and not tied to any particular GUI framework. It's also hardware-accelerated, using the [`glow`] crate as an interface to OpenGL.

## Usage

First, you need to create a [`GlContext`], which is just a wrapper around a [`glow::Context`].

```rust
let context = unsafe {
    let gl = glow::Context::from_loader_function(/* ... */);
    piet_glow::GlContext::new(gl)
};
```

Note that creating a [`GlContext`] is unsafe, since it assumes that the context is current.

Once you have a [`GlContext`], you can call the [`render_context`] method to get a type that implements [`piet::RenderContext`].

```rust
unsafe {
    let mut ctx = context.render_context(window_width, window_height);

    ctx.clear(Color::WHITE);
    ctx.finish().unwrap();
}
```

## Implementation

I built [`piet-glow`] on top of another crate I wrote, [`piet-hardware`]. [`piet-hardware`] does all of the heavy lifting; it converts the higher-level drawing operations to rendering textured triangles. From there, [`piet-glow`] only implements the interface to OpenGL that [`piet-hardware`] expects.

It is definitely possible to implement [`piet-hardware`] for other GPU backends. Most notably, this would be nice for [`wgpu`] drawing, but Vulkan and DirectX are also possible. However, I'm not familiar with those APIs. I *could* become familiar with them, but I'd rather move at a fast velocity with what I want to do rather than implement GPU APIs when I already know OpenGL. To clarify, it's on the to-do list, but I'd rather move onto other things first. That being said, if you'd like to implement support for one of these APIs, I'm always open to PRs!

## Thanks

[`piet-glow`], like any open-source project, is built on the sholders of giants. In that respect, I'd like to thank the following people:

- [Raph Levien] and the Druid team for creating the [`piet`] and [`kurbo`] crates. Being able to build on top of an existing, robust drawing framework is a huge boon.
- [Josh Groves] for creating [`glow`], which has acted as a great abstraction over OpenGL.
- [Nicolas Silva] for two important crates: [`lyon-tesselation`] and [`etagere`]. [`lyon-tesselation`] powers the tesselation process that converts shapes to triangles. [`etagere`] is the allocation strategy for the text rendering code. Without these two crates, [`piet-hardware`] would be much more difficult to implement.
- [Jeremy Soller] and others for creating [`cosmic_text`], which is used for font loading and text layout.
- [Yevhenii Reizner] for creating [`tiny-skia`], which is used for rendering gradients and clipping masks.
- [Alex Butler] for creating [`ab-glyph`], which is used to render text.
- Many, many more people who have contributed to the above projects, among others. I'm grateful for all of you.
